# Hello there; welcome 👋🏾



I'm a Software Engineer, Web Developer, and Backend System Architect who currently works as a freelancer, helping individuals and corporate institutions build scalable systems. I'm passionate about sharing knowledge, documentation, web engineering, and backend system designs, contributing to open source, and building personal technical projects. I create technical solutions for health, education, finance, legal, and other SMEs around the world.
